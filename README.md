Astro-Quote Generator 

**Main idea:**
The final SoftUni Project for the course Python Web Framework.
It is  called Astro-Quote Generator - "Knowledge from the Stars". 
It combines astrological knowledge and a hundred and more clever, practical,
spiritual, inspirational and deeply moving thoughts by famous and not so famous authors.

**Structure  of the  database:**
Quotes by Authors, each connected to one of the 12 Zodiac signs and 
its corresponding Element(Fire, Earth, Wind, Water).

**Main functions:**
--> For all users: Generating a random quote from the whole Database
whenever the landing page is refreshed. 

--> For registered regular users:
     -- Generating a random quote from the whole Database using 
        two types  of  filters - a filter by Zodiac sign and a filter by Element.
        The filters can be used separately and combined. 
     -- Submitting a new quote or an author as a suggestion to be included 
        in the database. If it is approved by the admin, it will be added to the database. 
        If not, it will be deleted. If the user manages  to provide the site with 10 quotes, 
        the user receives a Badge. The  successfully submitted quotes will be counted and 
        visible for the registered users.

--> For registered special users with a Badge:
     -- The successful users will receive the  special honour to be displayed as contributors 
        for the  site and  will have a special feature to change their background theme as they wish.
        There  are  several different background colour themes to choose from. 

**Front-end Effects:**
--> The main background changes its colour randomly every time it is loaded(like the sky). 
--> The decorating Star images have a hover action - they enlarge.
--> The main navbar text shines in yellowish colour(like  the  stars) when hovered.
--> The fixed Star on the left stays on screen when scrolling, and it is a hotlink to the top.
--> The top main front text above the main front image has a special shining effect.
